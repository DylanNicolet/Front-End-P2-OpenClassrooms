># **[Reservia Live Webpage link](https://dylannicolet.github.io/Front-End-P2-OpenClassrooms/)**

>## **In a few words**
This vacation planning tool allows users to find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice. 

Accommodations can also be filtered by theme, for example, their budget or their atmosphere.

>## **Key requirements for the prototype**
1. The search field had to be an input field and the button innactive.

2. Each card had to be made fully clickable leading to empty links for now.

3. Each filter had to have a hover effect implemented even if they are not functionnal. I decided to go with a simple fill in of the same color as the icon's background.

4. Navigation bar had to be fully functional
